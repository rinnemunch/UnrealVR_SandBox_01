# 🔥 Project 1 – VR Torch Interaction (UE5)

This project builds a **Blueprint-driven VR torch** inside **Unreal Engine 5.5.4**, using the VR Template’s built-in grab system.
The torch includes physics, hand-snap interaction, Niagara flame effects, warm lighting, and optional sound — a clean, reusable VR mechanic for any first-person VR project.
